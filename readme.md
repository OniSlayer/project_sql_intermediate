# Designing and Creating a DB

This is the code for the second project of the Intermediate SQL section of the DataQuest analyst path.

In this project, a bunch of csv's containing information about baseball statistics are **joined**  and uploaded to a sql database, creating a **normalized schema** and using the original tables to fill the new tables.

At the end, the **old tables are droped** and the new schema is done.
